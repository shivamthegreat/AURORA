# AURORA-1
I proudly introduces you to Aurora, an advanced artificial intelligence speech bot designed to enhance user experience through Python. Developed entirely using Python IDLE and VS Code, Aurora integrates a user-friendly GUI interface to manage its diverse functionalities. The core of our bot consists of three main components: main.py, config, and the driver file, all seamlessly combined in the main file for smooth operation.

Aurora excels in a variety of tasks, including providing the current date and time, opening folders and websites, playing media on YouTube, and telling jokes. It can also email contacts, fetch information from Wikipedia, create and close notes using Notepad, take screenshots, display system information, and provide weather updates and IP addresses. The bot even offers news updates and more.

To power these features, we have utilized a range of libraries and API keys, including Google Cloud API for various operations and Wolfram Alpha API for computational queries. With the pytx5 library handling its voice, Aurora represents a cutting-edge solution aimed at combating mental health challenges like depression and anxiety by serving as a reliable and interactive virtual companion.
